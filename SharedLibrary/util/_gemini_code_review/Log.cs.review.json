      "description": "The methods `Log`, `LogSuccess`, `Title`, `LogError`, and `Message` have redundant code. They all set the foreground color, write to the console, and reset the color. This could be extracted into a private helper method to reduce duplication."
    },
    {
      "type": "Performance",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The `Title` method uses `FiggleFonts.Standard.Render(title)` which might be computationally expensive for large titles or frequent calls. Consider caching the rendered banner if the same title is used repeatedly."
    },
    {
      "type": "Code Style",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The `Message` method has a commented-out line `//var banner = FiggleFonts.Alligator2.Render(message);`. If this functionality is not needed, it should be removed to avoid confusion."
    },
    {
      "type": "Code Style",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The methods `Log`, `LogSuccess`, `LogError` are very similar. Consider consolidating them into a single method with a parameter to specify the log level (e.g., Info, Success, Error) and map the log level to the corresponding color internally."
