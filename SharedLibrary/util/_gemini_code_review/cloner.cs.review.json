    {
      "type": "Performance",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "Using JSON serialization for deep cloning can be inefficient, especially for large or complex objects. Consider using a more performant method like a dedicated deep cloning library or implementing a custom deep cloning mechanism if performance is critical."
    },
    {
      "type": "Maintainability",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The code relies on the Newtonsoft.Json library. While widely used, it's an external dependency. Ensure this dependency is properly managed and documented."
    },
    {
      "type": "Error Handling",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The code throws an ArgumentNullException if the input object is null, which is good. However, it doesn't handle potential exceptions during the serialization/deserialization process. Consider adding a try-catch block to handle potential JsonException or other exceptions that might occur."
    },
    {
      "type": "Design",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The method is implemented as a static extension method, which is a common pattern for utility functions. However, consider whether this is the most appropriate approach for deep cloning. Depending on the context, a dedicated deep cloning service or a different design pattern might be more suitable."
    },
    {
      "type": "Code Style",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The use of `#pragma warning disable` and `#pragma warning enable` is generally discouraged unless there's a very specific reason. If there are warnings that need to be suppressed, it's better to address the root cause of the warnings rather than suppressing them globally."
    },
    {
      "type": "Maintainability",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The class name `Util` is very generic. Consider using a more descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the class, such as `ObjectCloningUtils` or `SerializationUtils`."
