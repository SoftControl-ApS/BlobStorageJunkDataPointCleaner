    {
      "type": "Code Duplication",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "The `GetFileName(string blobName)` and `GetFileName(CloudBlockBlob blob)` methods have identical logic. This duplication can lead to maintenance issues if the logic needs to be changed in the future."

    {
      "type": "Maintainability",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The logic for removing file extensions (.zip and .json) is hardcoded. If new file types are added in the future, this code will need to be updated in multiple places."
    },
    {
      "type": "Naming",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The class name `Util` is very generic. A more descriptive name related to file or blob operations would improve readability."
    },
    {
      "type": "Design",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The `GetFileName(DateOnly date, FileType filetype)` method uses a switch statement that could be replaced with a more concise approach, such as a dictionary lookup or a string interpolation based on a pattern."
    },
    {
      "type": "Maintainability",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The file name prefixes ('pd', 'pm', 'py', 'pt') are hardcoded. It would be better to store these in a configuration or a separate class for easier modification."
    },
    {
      "type": "Missing Documentation",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The methods lack XML documentation comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Adding documentation would improve code understanding and maintainability."
