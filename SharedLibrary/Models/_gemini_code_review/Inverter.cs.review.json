      "type": "Missing Initialization",

      "description": "The `Production` property is not initialized in the constructor or by default. This could lead to a `NullReferenceException` if it's accessed before being assigned a value."

      "type": "Partial Class Usage",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The class `Inverter` is declared as `partial`. This suggests that there might be other parts of this class defined elsewhere. If these other parts also define a constructor, it's important to ensure that `Production` is initialized consistently across all constructor definitions."
