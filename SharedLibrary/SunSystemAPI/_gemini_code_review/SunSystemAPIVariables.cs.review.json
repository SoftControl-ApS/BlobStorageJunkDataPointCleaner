    {
      "type": "Hardcoded Base URL",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "The base URL for the API is hardcoded in the `SunSystemAPI` class. This makes it difficult to change the API endpoint without modifying the code and recompiling. It also poses a security risk if the code is deployed in different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) as it might accidentally point to the wrong environment."
    },
    {
      "type": "Excessive Timeout",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "The `HttpClient` is configured with an extremely long timeout of 1000 seconds (over 16 minutes). This can lead to application hangs if the API server is unresponsive. It's recommended to use a more reasonable timeout value (e.g., 30-60 seconds) and implement proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff."
    },
    {
      "type": "Potential Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "The `GetAllInvertersAsync` method constructs the API endpoint URL by directly concatenating the `installationId` parameter. If the `installationId` is not properly validated, an attacker could potentially craft a very large or malicious value that could cause the API server to consume excessive resources or crash, leading to a denial of service."
    },
    {
      "type": "Insufficient Input Validation",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "The `installationId` parameter in `GetAllInvertersAsync` is not validated before being used to construct the API request URL. This could potentially lead to issues if the input is not a valid integer or if it contains special characters that could be interpreted differently by the API server."
    },
    {
      "type": "Blocking Call in Async Method",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "The `GetInverterModelList` method uses a blocking call (`.Result`) within an asynchronous method. This defeats the purpose of using asynchronous programming and can lead to performance issues and deadlocks. The method should be rewritten to use `await` instead of `.Result`."
    },
    {
      "type": "Insufficient Error Handling",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "While the code uses `response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode()`, it doesn't handle potential exceptions that might occur during the API call (e.g., network errors, timeouts). It's recommended to wrap the API calls in `try-catch` blocks to handle these exceptions gracefully and provide more informative error messages."
    },
    {
      "type": "Missing Authentication",
      "severity": "High",
      "description": "The code does not appear to implement any authentication mechanism when communicating with the API. This means that anyone who can access the API endpoint can potentially retrieve sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. It's crucial to implement proper authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) to secure the API."
    },
    {
      "type": "Insecure Communication (HTTP)",
      "severity": "High",
      "description": "The code uses `http` instead of `https` for the API base address. This means that the communication between the client and the API server is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can intercept and potentially modify the data being transmitted. It's crucial to use `https` to ensure secure communication."
